When I was trying to build the decoder, I was firstly regard the 2 original decoder_2to4 with 8 outputs totully as the 
decoder output,but there will allways "TWO 1" which is against the "MOST ONE 1" principle so I realized that outputs should
still be composed by AND GATES. It is the biggest bug I have ever met in the designing period.

So,when building some circuits with spesific functions, first step is clear the method of inputs and outputs.

the binary numbers are inputs, I was considerding how to combine the 4 inputs of two decoder_2to4 with the actuall 3 inputs

after finishing the inputs and outputs, just find the intersection.
