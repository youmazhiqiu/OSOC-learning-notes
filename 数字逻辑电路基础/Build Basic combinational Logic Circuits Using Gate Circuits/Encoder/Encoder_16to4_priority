When building this, what came to my mind first is : my Encoder_4to2_priority didn't treat undifined value well, so it can not be used to build the 16to4 module

So I turned to add output X of Encoder_4to2_priority, Then I begun to build this huge job

At first I have no idea what to do, until I gradually realized what form the output should be : still OR GATES
But in this way, what role Encoder_4to2_priority played? It has 4 input and 2 output , 4 of it will cover all the inputs, but only half outputs
So I need to use And Gates and NOT Gates to specificied each outputs of each binary output. #   regard Encoder_4to2_priority's output as a bit , trans it to demical (one hot)
After this actions demical turns to demical. So the 4to2 played a role of Priority_giving.
After noticing this, I begun to considerate how to implement this:
Each 4to2 can make sure 4 demical number follow the principle of priority, then how to link this 4 number and another 4 number?
The output X I build before representing (0000) is the key, just pass it.

AND GATES and OR GATES are my best friends
AND allways used for input filter because of the all for one or condition logic
OR allways used for output selector because of the one for all logic

I love NOT GATE.
