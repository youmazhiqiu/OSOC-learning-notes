With the power of XOR Gate, I implemented the priority logic:
When Y3 = 1, just follow Y3
When Y3 = 0, check whether Y2 = Y3, If not, then Y2 = 1, just follow Y2
                                    If euqal, then Y2 = 0, check whether Y1 = Y2，If not, then Y1 = 1, just follow Y1
                                                                                  If equal, then Y1 = 0, check whether Y0 = Y1, If not, then Y0 = 1, just follow Y0
                                                                                                                                If equal, then Y0 = 0, illeagul(undefined)

Obviously, the logic is right, but how to implement it in circuits became my problem

I need branch circuit 。

I finally finished
I use NOR Gate to pass the 0s,
then I use the specific to build the output

I still have no idea how to display the float number, so I put it as 0.
