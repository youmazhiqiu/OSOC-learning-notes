What need to select:
which DIP as input
which mode to display

So, focus on the input selection first
I can use the 4to1 selctor logic to finish, that is all

Then focus on the mode selection

with AND GATE can combine Selection signal an input signal together, clear selectied signal

how much of it do I need?

I need to double the abcdefg OR GATEs input bits, and make the two sets of signal clearselectied 
then tie to the OR GATES .
That is all

Special thanks to BITS-MORE OR GATE
